# Analyzing Cryptocurrency Data with Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Project Overview
A fictional investment bank company, "Accountability Accounting," is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The purpose of this project is to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new cryptocurency investment. The [crypto_data](https://github.com/retroxsky06/Cryptocurrencies/blob/main/crypto_data.csv) is preprocessed through Pandas to fit into Unsupervised Machine Learning models. Clustering is utilized to group the data and hvPlot visualization is applied.  

#### Technical Analysis Deliverables
- Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
- Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
- Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
- Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results

### Software & Resources
- Python 
- scikit-learn 
- hvPlot 
- Plotly
